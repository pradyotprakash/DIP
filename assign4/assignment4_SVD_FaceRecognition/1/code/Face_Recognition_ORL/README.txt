Since the database is too large to be attached to the moodle assignment submission interface, please add the ORL face database from the link:
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/DTG/attarchive/pub/data/att_faces.zip.
Extract the database and add it to the folder containing the 'Main_ORL' Matlab script under the name 'database'. After this is done, the script should run smoothly
with the execution time of less than 5 seconds (may vary from system to system).

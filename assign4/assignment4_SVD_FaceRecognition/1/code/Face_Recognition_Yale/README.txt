Since the database is too large to be attached to the moodle assignment submission interface, please add the ORL face database from the link:
http:m http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/CS663_ Fall2016/HW4/CroppedYale.rar.
Extract the database and add it to the folder containing the 'Main_ORL' Matlab script under the name 'database'. After this is done, the script should run smoothly
with the execution time of less than 5 minutes(may vary from system to system).

We made two submissions, one from Yash Sanghvi's account, 13D070042.

We had the initial code ready but the tuning was taking a lot of time and convergence was not being achieved for Q2. Inspite of having the initial code ready by Monday(we have GitHub commits to prove this), we faced issues and had to submit the initial version of the code through this account. I am submitting the modified code for mean-shift segmentation. In th end, we had to resort to a smaller version of the image. Both the submissions contain the Harris corner detection exactly the same.

I understand that we are liable to be penalized, but due to the slower configuration of our systems we couldn't help much. Please evaluate this one as well and consider the best of the two.

We worked with a window size of 9 for both the images.

Tuned parameters for the 'croppedLion' image:
sigma = 0.6
weighting factor of the enhancement = 3.1

Tuned parameters for the 'croppedLion' image:
sigma = 0.5
weighting factor of the enhancement = 8

These parameters give a reasonable enhancement of the images.

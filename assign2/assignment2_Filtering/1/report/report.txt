We worked with a window size of 12 for both the images.

Tuned parameters for the 'croppedLion' image:
sigma = 2
weighting factor of the enhancement = 4

Tuned parameters for the 'croppedLion' image:
sigma = 1.5
weighting factor of the enhancement = 1

These parameters give a reasonable enhancement of the images.
